Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive exploration of modern cybersecurity challenges by:

Identifying and Analyzing Vulnerabilities:
Examining security flaws in web applications and network systems.

Testing Methodologies:
Employing both manual and automated testing methods using tools such as Nessus, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Wireshark.

Remediation Strategies:
Proposing effective solutions based on detailed functional, performance, and design assessments.

Agile Project Execution:
Managing the project through clear planning, sprint scheduling, and continuous monitoring.

Project Phases
1. Introduction
Project Name: Exploring Cyber Security: Understanding Threats and Solutions in the Digital Age
Purpose: Perform a hands-on cybersecurity assessment to identify vulnerabilities, evaluate their impact, and propose remediation strategies.
Scope: Conduct vulnerability assessments on designated web applications and network systems using both manual and automated methods.
2. Ideation Phase
Brainstorming: Generate ideas based on known attack vectors and past experiences.
Empathy Mapping: Capture user and stakeholder concerns regarding data privacy and system security.
Feature Grouping: Categorize vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, CSRF, etc.).
3. Requirement Analysis
Vulnerability Listing: Document identified vulnerabilities along with their CWE numbers.
Risk & Impact Analysis: Assess risks for vulnerabilities such as IDOR, CSRF, Security Misconfiguration, Unvalidated Redirects, and XXE.
Solution Requirements: Define risk evaluation, remediation measures, and comprehensive documentation.
Technology Stack: Utilize tools like Nessus, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit, and the Kali Linux operating system.
4. Project Design Phase
Problem-Solution Fit
Problem Identification: Recognize the rapid evolution of cyber attacks and critical vulnerabilities.
Business Impact: Evaluate how vulnerabilities affect system integrity and user trust.
Alignment: Ensure that the proposed methods directly address the identified security gaps.
Proposed Solution
Automated & Manual Testing:
Integrate automated vulnerability scanning (using Nessus) with manual testing (using OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Wireshark).
Remediation Strategies:
Implement secure coding practices, advanced encryption (AES, RSA), multi-factor authentication, and continuous monitoring.
Solution Architecture
Input Layer: Data collection from target web applications and network systems.
Processing Layer: Aggregation and analysis of vulnerability scan results.
Remediation Layer: Prioritization and application of countermeasures.
Monitoring & Reporting Layer: Continuous security event tracking using SOC/SIEM tools (with dashboards such as burndown charts).
5. Project Planning Phase
Sprint Schedule
Sprint-1: Cyber Threat Identification (7 Story Points)
Example: Identify and categorize various cyber threats (malware, phishing, ransomware).

Sprint-2: Digital Forensics & Analysis (7 Story Points)
Example: Analyze logs to extract key insights; investigate the origin of an attack.

Sprint-3: Cybersecurity Defence Mechanisms (7 Story Points)
Example: Implement encryption methods (AES, RSA) and set up multi-factor authentication.

Sprint-4: Network Security & Monitoring (6 Story Points)
Example: Analyze network packet data using Wireshark and create awareness material.

Sprint-5: Security Awareness & Best Practices (5 Story Points)
Example: Develop training modules and educate users on best practices.

Velocity: Approximately 6.4 story points per sprint.

Visualization: A burndown chart is used to monitor progress and ensure timely completion.

6. Functional and Performance Testing
Functional Testing
Verify identified vulnerabilities (e.g., IDOR, CSRF, XSS) using tools such as Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and Nessus.
Detailed test cases document the methods and outcomes.
Performance Testing
Monitor server response times and resource utilization during scans.
Ensure that scanning does not significantly degrade system performance.
Comprehensive test reports and analyses are included.
7. Project Executable Files
Contains all source code, scripts, and executable files necessary for running vulnerability scans and analysis.
Includes setup instructions and guidelines to reproduce the testing environments.
