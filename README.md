PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project, "Exploring Cyber Security: Understanding Threats and Solutions in the Digital Age," provides a comprehensive exploration of modern cybersecurity challenges. The project involves:

Identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities in web applications and network systems.
Utilizing both manual and automated testing methods (using tools such as Nessus, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Wireshark).
Proposing effective remediation strategies based on detailed functional, performance, and design assessments.
Executing the project using agile methodologies, with clear planning, sprint scheduling, and continuous monitoring.
PROJECT PHASES
Introduction

Project Name: Exploring Cyber Security: Understanding Threats and Solutions in the Digital Age
Purpose: To perform a hands-on cybersecurity assessment, identify vulnerabilities, evaluate their impact, and propose remediation strategies.
Scope: Vulnerability assessments on designated web applications and network systems using both manual and automated methods.
Ideation Phase

Brainstorming ideas based on known attack vectors and past experiences.
Developing an empathy map to capture user and stakeholder concerns regarding data privacy and system security.
Grouping features to categorize vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, CSRF, etc.).
Requirement Analysis

Listing identified vulnerabilities along with their corresponding CWE numbers.
Analyzing the risks and business impacts of vulnerabilities like IDOR, CSRF, Security Misconfiguration, Unvalidated Redirects, and XXE.
Defining solution requirements including risk evaluation, remediation measures, and comprehensive documentation.
Technology stack includes tools such as Nessus, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit, and the Kali Linux operating system.
Project Design Phase

Problem-Solution Fit:
Problem Identification: Recognizing the rapid evolution of cyber attacks and the critical vulnerabilities that exist.
Business Impact: Evaluating how these vulnerabilities affect system integrity and user trust.
Alignment: Ensuring that the proposed methods directly address the identified security gaps.
Proposed Solution:
Integrate automated vulnerability scanning (using Nessus) with manual testing (using OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Wireshark).
Implement remediation strategies such as secure coding practices, advanced encryption (AES, RSA), multi-factor authentication, and continuous monitoring.
Solution Architecture:
Input Layer: Data collection from target web applications and network systems.
Processing Layer: Aggregation and analysis of vulnerability scan results.
Remediation Layer: Prioritization and application of countermeasures.
Monitoring & Reporting Layer: Continuous security event tracking using SOC/SIEM tools, with visual dashboards (e.g., burndown charts) to monitor progress.
Project Planning Phase

Sprint Schedule:
Sprint-1: Cyber Threat Identification (Story Points: 7)
Example Stories: Identify and categorize various cyber threats (malware, phishing, ransomware).
Sprint-2: Digital Forensics & Analysis (Story Points: 7)
Example Stories: Analyze logs and extract key insights; investigate the origin of an attack.
Sprint-3: Cybersecurity Defence Mechanisms (Story Points: 7)
Example Stories: Implement encryption methods (AES, RSA) and set up multi-factor authentication.
Sprint-4: Network Security & Monitoring (Story Points: 6)
Example Stories: Analyze network packet data using Wireshark and create awareness material.
Sprint-5: Security Awareness & Best Practices (Story Points: 5)
Example Stories: Develop training modules and educate users on best practices.
Velocity: Approximately 6.4 story points per sprint.
A burndown chart is used to visualize progress and ensure timely completion.
Functional and Performance Testing

Functional Testing:
Verified each identified vulnerability (e.g., IDOR, CSRF, XSS) using tools such as Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and Nessus.
Detailed test cases document the methods and outcomes.
Performance Testing:
Monitored server response times and resource utilization during scans.
Ensured that scanning did not significantly degrade system performance.
Test reports and detailed analysis are included in the documentation.
